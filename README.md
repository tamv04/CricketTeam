# CricketTeam
One thing that everyone who knows me well knows that I love sports. Whether it’s the
Lakers running it back after GM Rob Pelinka played chess from the recent trade
deadline, the Dodgers and their bullpen looking as bad and inconsistent as I’ve ever
seen, or the Rams paying for it now but having a Super Bowl to show for it, I love
following sports. My favorite sport is baseball, as it was the first sport that I played,
watched, and loved. As it turns out, baseball has its roots from the sport of cricket. The
reason that I even got interested in it was because I was at one of my discussion
sections for an Electrical Engineering class at 8 AM at UCLA (yes, 8 AM, not 8 PM) and
the TA was bleary-eyed and saw I was the only one there, crazy as that seems. I asked
the TA why the tiredness and I was told it was because of watching cricket. Now,
cricket, in its original form, is a match that can go up to five days long. Five days! It is
the test of skill, will, and endurance, as each side waits for the others to crack one by
one by one. Cricket has seen expanded to include one-day international and T20 over
matches (including a new league in the United States called Major League Cricket). At
the heart of it, it’s a sport where the colonized (including India, the West Indies, and
Australia, among others) are getting back at the colonizers (namely, England).
To help me recreate these cricket teams (those who follow cricket will see I’ve taken the
liberty of using teams and players from all formats), you will write the implementation of
the CricketTeam class using a doubly linked list, which should be sorted alphabetically
according to last name, then first name. You will also implement a couple of algorithms
that operate on the CricketTeam class
